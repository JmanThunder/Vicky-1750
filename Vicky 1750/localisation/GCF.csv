EVTNAME95671;The non-German territories;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC95671;Now that we have fulfilled our destiny and united the German people under one banner, the question of our non-German lands remains. There is cries for independence, or at the very least, increased autonomy from $COUNTRY$. Refusing will no doubt greatly upset the other great powers as well as our population. Many voices in Government say that granting our non-German territories independence or even just extended autonomy is the best course of action in order to minimise damage to our reputation on the world stage as well as satisfying our population.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
